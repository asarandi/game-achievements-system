### intro
this is my solution to a coding challenge i received when i applied for a backend engineer position.

the project can be summarized as _**"an achievements system for a fictional online game"**_. please see `SPEC.md` for challenge details.

i decided to implement a restful api in go, so this is a web server connected to a database that exposes several endpoints which accept `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests in order to **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete** records

project components:
- server: https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/
- router: https://github.com/gorilla/mux
- database: https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm

### project files

##### achievements.go
- individual functions that are run at the end of each game to check if a player qualifies for an achievement
##### config.go
- program configuration settings: server listening address, database file name, etc
##### game.go
- contains game related logic: adding teams to games, setting winners at the end of a game, etc
##### handlers.go
- functions responsible for each endpoint and request type
##### main.go
- initializes other program components and launches server
##### main_test.go
- unit tests and sample data driver
##### model.go
- data structures and generalized functions for manipulating database records
##### response.go
- errors and json response encoding
##### routes.go
- endpoints, http request methods



### running
before running the program, make sure to install the dependencies, this only has to be done once:

`go get github.com/gorilla/mux`

`go get github.com/jinzhu/gorm`

`go get github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/sqlite`

**to build and run:**

`go build && ./game-achievements-system`

**or just run without building:**

`go run .`

program should print `server ready at: 0.0.0.0:4242`


### testing

file `main_test.go` contains unit tests and also acts as a driver.

the test scenario is simple:
- create the four default achievements
- create 10 sample members (players)
- create 4 sample teams
- start 2 games
- update member stats
- close games
- verify that server awarded correct wins and achievements to qualifying members

to run the tests:
```shell script
go test -v
```

the test will fail if the database file is already populated with data, if that happens just remove `database.sqlite` and re-run the test - or - you could edit `config.go` and set `databaseFile = ":memory:"`


### adding new achievements
to address `SPEC.md` requirement #7, "_add a new statistic and create a new achievement .._":

to add a simple statistic like "number of collected coins" during a game we would simply add it to our `Stat` object which is defined in `models.go`; it might look like this:
```go
type Stat struct {
	gorm.Model
	GameID       uint `json:"game_id"`
	TeamID       uint `json:"team_id"`
	MemberID     uint `json:"member_id"`
	NumAttacks   uint `json:"num_attacks"`
	NumHits      uint `json:"num_hits"`
	AmountDamage uint `json:"amount_damage"`
	NumKills     uint `json:"num_kills"`
	InstantKills uint `json:"instant_kills"`
	NumAssists   uint `json:"num_assists"`
	NumSpells    uint `json:"num_spells"`
	SpellsDamage uint `json:"spells_damage"`
	NumCoins     uint `json:"num_coins"`		// <<--- we added a new statistic
	IsWinner     bool `json:"is_winner"`
}
```

next, we want to add the achievement to the database; here is one way of doing that:

```sh
curl -X POST 0.0.0.0:4242/achievements --data '{"name": "1UP", "slug": "oneup", "desc": "You have collected 100 or more coins during a single game! Wow!", "img": "https://www.pngfind.com/pngs/m/22-226955_mario-mushroom-png-mario-1-up-mushroom-transparent.png"}'
```

if successful, the server replies ` "success":true, "code":201 `
```sh
{"success":true,"code":201,"message":"ok","result":{"ID":5,"CreatedAt":"2019-08-09T23:44:41.040203-07:00","UpdatedAt":"2019-08-09T23:44:41.040203-07:00","DeletedAt":null,"slug":"oneup","name":"1UP","desc":"You have collected 100 or more coins during a single game! Wow!","img":"https://www.pngfind.com/pngs/m/22-226955_mario-mushroom-png-mario-1-up-mushroom-transparent.png"}}
```


then, in `achievements.go` we want to add a function which will check if a member qualifies for the achievement; function signature should be `func (Stat) bool` it might look like this:
```go
func isOneUpAward(stat Stat) bool {
	if stat.NumCoins >= 100 {
		return true
	}
	return false
}
```

we also have to "register" the achievement by adding it to the `asf` list which is in `achievements.go`;
```
    asf = []typeAsf{
		{achievement: Achievement{}, slug: "sharpshooter", function: isSharpshooterAward},
		{achievement: Achievement{}, slug: "bruiser", function: isBruiserAward},
		{achievement: Achievement{}, slug: "veteran", function: isVeteranAward},
		{achievement: Achievement{}, slug: "bigwinner", function: isBigwinnerAward},
		{achievement: Achievement{}, slug: "oneup", function: isOneUpAward},		// <<--- 1UP new achievement
	}
```
it is important that the `slug` field matches the `slug` that we previously inserted into database.

last step is to restart the server. at the end of each game the new achievement will be awarded to qualifying members.

##### note:

we can create more interesting achievements by using sql capabilities of the database,

for example to check if a member qualifies for a _"Win-Five-Games-In-A-Row"_ achievement:
```go
func isWonLastFive(stat Stat) bool {
	lastFiveStats := []Stat{}
	db.Order("CreatedAt desc").Limit(5).Joins("JOIN games ON games.id = stats.game_id AND games.status = ? AND stats.member_id = ?", finishedGame, stat.MemberID).Find(&lastFiveStats)
	if len(lastFiveStats) == 5 {
		result := true
		for i := range lastFiveStats { result = result && lastFiveStats[i].IsWinner }
		return result
	}
	return false;
}
```
